<p>You want to have an authentification system for rails, but the current ones doesn’t fit your needs ? Well you may want to take a look at the one I just released.</p>

<p>It offers features like being able to display account information even on static pages. It also gives you a complete administration to handle users, a way to put users into groups, etc.</p>

<p>Take a look, it’s <a href="http://penso.info/rails/auth_generator/">here</a>.</p>
