<p>Ok I finaly got my D200, and even I didn’t have the time to play with it for long, I have to say I’m <em>impressed</em>. The build quality is awesome, it feels strong  and I will bring it with me on travel for sure. See my “flickr D200 tag”:http://flickr.com/photos/penso/tags/d200/.</p>

<p>I had my mamiya 7ii 3 weeks ago, and developed the first roll. It’s georgous, the quality of the 6x7 provia is as good you expect it to be. The bad side of that is I now need to get an Epson flatbed scanner, sick.</p>

<p>I feel like I need to setup another photoblog to polluate the web.</p>

<p>The flight ticket for India have been bought, and we will leave around March, 15th for 2 months.</p>
