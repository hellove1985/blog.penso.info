<p>The website “oswd”:http://www.oswd.org/ is dead for weeks now, and I feel like it won’t be back soon. Looks like someone needs to rewrite a similar one using “recent technology”:http://www.rubyonrails.org/ with ajax and stuff. So where will you now fetch your HTML templates some nice designers did for you ? :)</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: oswd is back online with a new design. Looks like a split happened between the owner and the main developer, who moved the database and the website to  “this website”:http://www.openwebdesign.org/.</p>

<p>I now use rails 0.14.X on my outgoing projects, much faster implementation on specific parts of the code. Go for it!</p>
