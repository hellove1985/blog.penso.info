1998, Internet grows quicker than anyone expects. I'm 19 years old and still
live at my parent's house, hang out on IRC, use FTP to download, and run
Linux for fun. I'm a complete geek.

I decide to [create a
website](http://linuxfr.org/images/historique/28juin1998.jpg), I'm not sure
what I'll do with it. I don't know if I want something closer to
[FreshMeat](http://freecode.com/) or [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org/), but
I buy a domain name anyway. I hang out on #Linuxfr, an IRC channel, and decide
*[linuxfr.org](http://linuxfr.org)* would be a nice DNS. Its first whois
description is "Utilisateurs d√©biles de Linux" which translates to something
like *Stupid Linux Users*. We kept this for years.

The first server hosting the website is a 486DX4 100Mhz with open case, under
my feet, at my employer's office. It then later moves to a paid hosting and when
the site becomes popular, we'll never have to pay anymore[^1].

What I don't know at the time is I will be spending literally hours per day in
the following years running the website, writing code from mod_perl to PHP[^2].
I'll even write a template language [Templeet](http://www.templeet.org) with my
friend [Pascal Courtois](http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/pascal-courtois/0/949/a60),
or implement a Karma Score[^3] trying to lower the noise from annoying users.

Time involved on the website, and dedication from many core users wasn't
wasted. It ended up being one of the biggest website in France, with over 40
millions hits per month. Most website never reach this audience and even as of
today it still does [close to 1 million hits per
day](http://linuxfr.org/webalizer/). It became the French most popular website
about Free Software, and [almost
won](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7029?page=0,3) the Linux Readers'
Choice Awards on 2003.

While I use [Debian](http://www.debian.org) on all my servers, my focus isn't
on Linux nor Free Software anymore. As most of the Silicon Valley geeks, I
moved to [Apple](http://www.apple.com) for my desktop, and I now develop iOS
applications[^4]. Free Software evangelists will say I sold my soul to the Devil
but I have to confess doing iOS is one of the most fun I had in my career.

I made [LinuxFr](http://linuxfr.org) as a non profit project. I'm proud it
still runs today, with a [great team](http://linuxfr.org/team) of Engineers and
still as a non profit. Friends helped on the way in the first years: [Laurent
Vallar](https://plus.google.com/116243126673573792336/), [Fabien
Seisen](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/fabienseisen), [Yann
Hirou](http://www.hirou.org/) and others I forget mentioning. Like me, they all
took their paths, and if you still visit LinuxFr you should thank the current
team and contributors.

15 years ago I founded LinuxFr, and oh my I'm glad my HTML skill improved
since[^5].

[^2]: You still can find [daCode](http://dacode.sourceforge.net/index.en.html), an old PHP CMS I wrote.
[^3]: This karma score has pissed a lot of users but in the end, it did lower the noise.
[^4]: I released [Push4](http://2apn.com), and [Liker](http://likerapp.com/purchase). I contracted for clients on [Urban trip](http://urbantripapp.com) and [VU'](http://www.agencevu.com/iphone/).
