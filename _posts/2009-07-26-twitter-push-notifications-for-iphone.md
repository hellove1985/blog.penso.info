Well now than <a href="http://blog.penso.info/2009/07/24/push-notification_appnotificationscom-submitted/">I've submitted my iPhone notifications application</a>, I'm working on cool features. I've just finished one who gives you <a href="http://twitpic.com/bot4s">notifications for every public replies</a> someone sends you on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>.

You'll be able to use it as soon as Apple will have had approved my application.
