I'm going to be in India for 3 months this October 2011, with a Leica M9 and a
few lenses, and will be blogging from here and my photography website : <a
href="http://www.fabienpenso.com">India Leica M9</a>. You can like my Facebook
page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pensophotography">Penso Photography</a>
as I will post updates there.

As last time, my plan is to get an Enfield 350 and ride the North (I did 3
months in the South). I had hoped to get to Ladakh but October will probably be
too cold already, therefor I'll just visit Rajasthan, Gujarat and if I have
time, ride all the way to Benares and Calcutta.

If you have advices or are looking for photography with a Leica M9, check my
work soon :) I'll try to upload some real time on my Facebook page.
