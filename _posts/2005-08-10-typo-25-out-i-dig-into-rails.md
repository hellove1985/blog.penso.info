<p>Hey <a href="http://blog.leetsoft.com/articles/2005/08/06/typo-2-5-released">Typo 2.5</a> is officialy out but I just don’t want to loose time to upgrade. Take a look if you want.
<br /><br />
I finaly bought the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/">pragmatic</a> rails book to dig into rails. That’s it, I am already writing a login system for rails, the first thing I need for my <a href="http://www.dlfp.org/">next website</a> (which might never be online :). The <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/LoginGenerator">login generator</a> isn’t enough, I want my users to subscribe through their email address. Look for something on my blog, I’ll put some code soon.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Are you looking for a newzbin (binaries usenet) website where you can just download nzb files for free ? Send me a mail, I might have something for you. If you are using the <a href="http://www.free.fr">free.fr</a> usenet server, or <a href="http://www.giganews.com/">giganews</a>, it <b>will</b> be even better.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am now certified on <a href="http://www.cacert.org">cacert</a>.  If you need to be certified and are traveling around Paris or France, you can ping me.</p>

Added in the TODO: upgrade Typo <i>later</i></p>
