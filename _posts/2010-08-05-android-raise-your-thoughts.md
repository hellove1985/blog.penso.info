What's your thought about the raise of Android compared to the iPhone? They now sell <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/200k-android-phones-sold-every-day-20100805/">200K devices a day</a>.

As a user, and as a developer? My feeling is users buying iPhones are more willing to buy applications on the appstore than Android users, which only buy... a phone. But I may be wrong.

As a user, I like the fact I'm connected all the time to IM like gtalk.
