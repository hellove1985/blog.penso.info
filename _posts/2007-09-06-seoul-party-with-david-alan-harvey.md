On my way to Seoul I met <a href="http://www.davidalanharvey.com/">David Alan Harvey</a>, a <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/">Magnum</a> photographer, who posted on his blog about being there for a workshop he was giving to Korean students, and an assignment about Korea than few Magnum photographers were shooting. Well the party with David was great, and lots of Alcohol has been drunk. Anyway, as the fun is better with memories, here is some audio recorded during the party.

As David says : "... and I think I'm a little fucked up ...". Enjoy.
