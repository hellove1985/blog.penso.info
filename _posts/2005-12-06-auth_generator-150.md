<p>Rails users, I finaly released the <a href="http://penso.info/code/auth_generator">auth_generator </a> v1.5.0. You can now use your favorite crypting algo (md5, sha, make your own, salted depending of the login) to store passwords.</p>

<p>You now have unit testing for the model. You can disable account creation if you wish, select the size of the buddy icons. And there is a <a href="https://trac.penso.info/trac/auth_generator">trac</a> too!</p>

<p>Auth_generator is an authentification generator for rails. It gives you a complete administration interface to handle users. You should be able to install it within minutes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>, Please use the 1.5.1 version. The 1.5.0 is broken, !$@.</p>

<p><em><strong>Another update</strong></em>, You should use 1.5.2 in fact, 1.5.1 was still broken!</p>
