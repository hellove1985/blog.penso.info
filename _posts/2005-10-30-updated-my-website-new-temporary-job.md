<p>h2. Website updated</p>

<p>Yeah, I have finaly done it. I have updated my website and it’s now powered by “rails”:http://www.rubyonrails/. In the same time, I’ve changed the design.</p>

<p>The top picture has been taken during a Tango play. No photoshop at all, I was just too far away with my 35mm lens, but the result isn’t that bad afterall.</p>

<p>h2. Temporary job</p>

<p>I’m now working on a 1 month mission for “pekin”:http://www.pekin.fr/ to fix one of their customer website which use old non-object PHP (uurk). “Pekin”:http://www.pekin.fr/ is a design company on the web, based in Le Marais, Paris. Yes, the url is correct.</p>

<p>h2. Photography</p>

<p>I’m getting convinced I should buy a new film scanner, and the “Nikon 5000”:http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&grp=98&productNr=9238 is the best deal. The price felt down since last year, and it’s now affordable for my wallet. On the photography side I’m looking on the Mamiya 7ii (medium format 6x7). Have you ever worked with it ? Mail me and send me your feedbacks (or you can send me your camera).</p>

<p>h2. Computer project</p>

<p>I’m still working on “uucpssh”:http://www.uucpssh.org/ and the new server now receive emails for few domains. It looks like the spam filtering works much better. Within few weeks I hope to switch to the new website, also powered by “rails”:http://www.rubyonrails.org/ as you might have guessed already.</p>

<p>The “auth<em>generator”:http://penso.info/rails/auth</em>generator/  for rails has been updated to v1.3.0. Only bugfixes, thanks HK.</p>
