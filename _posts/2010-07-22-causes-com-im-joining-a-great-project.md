I'm now part of <a href="http://causes.com">Causes</a> which already has nice
<a href="http://exchange.causes.com/resources/success-stories/">success
stories</a>, but what is Causes?

> Causes was founded on the belief that in a healthy society, anyone
can participate in change by informing and inspiring others. The most
successful movements have always been born out of and held together by the
bonds of real world relationships, and online social networks present never
before seen opportunities for organizing. We strive to build tools for people
to mobilize their friends for collective action, spread the word to friends of
friends and acquaintances, and eventually launch movements that span local
communities or even the globe.

<a href="http://causes.com">Causes</a> is also one of the largest current
website using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, and is
recruiting developers. So <a href="mailto:fabien@causes.com">get in touch with
me</a> if you're looking and feel like a Rails hacker, and feel free to follow
<a href="http://twitter.com/caretopia">@caretopia</a>.
