<p>A tango play a while ago in Paris, near Champs-Elysees. There were no Photoshop on this one, I was very far with a M6TTL and 35mm and tried to play with the scene. <br />

I am just playing as I just bought a calibration cell for my screen, finaly.<br /><br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.visapourlimage.com/">Visa pour l’Image</a> is now over. I was very surprised how things were going on over there. It was very professionnal and I was frustrated to not have brought any portfolio to show to agencies, magazines and other photographers. I’ll be ready for next year, hopefuly.</p>
