Last week I met <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Eric Ries</a> during a talk at <a href="http://www.lacantine.org/">la cantine</a>. He talked about how he uses continuous integration for his company (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/startuplessonslearned/2009-09-29-the-lean-startup-at-stanford-entrepreneurial-thought-leader-seminar">his slides</a>), too bad the Appstore process does not allow this for iPhone apps...
