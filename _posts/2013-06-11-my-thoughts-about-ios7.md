93% of users are already running iOS6, if you are developing a new iOS
application, you'd be a fool not using iOS7 from now on. This is why I love iOS
compared to others (Android in mind): as a developer I can focus on the latest
features knowing my users will have them.

Big changes are brought by iOS7, Apple completely changed the UI. You might
like or not like it, but it takes *big balls* to brings such changes on an
existing very popular platform.

The biggest change anyone is seeing right now is flat design, new icons and a
complete new UI. Many seems not to like it, and my Twitter stream is full of
complains about the icons.

But Apple is very well known to rewrite things they didn't get perfect the
first time[^1], so I don't worry about iOS7 at all. I wouldn't be surprised if
the released version of iOS7 next fall is different from the one the one we've
seen yesterday. Apple already improved their [Maps
app](http://www.apple.com/ios/maps/), they'll improve
[iOS7](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/). They are able to iterate with small
changes because of their [over the
air](http://www.imore.com/update-iphone-ipad-software-air-ota) updates and
everyone will benefit from them.

I don't like the current icons, I don't like the new ActionSheet but I'm very
confident Apple knows exactly where they're going, and will improve what we
complain about. With the announcements of the [Mac
Pro](http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/), the new [MacBook
Air](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) with additional battery life and
[OSX Mavericks](http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/), overall that was a great
Keynote. Wish I was there.

[This video](http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/) Apple displayed in the
beginning of the WWDC is a must see.
