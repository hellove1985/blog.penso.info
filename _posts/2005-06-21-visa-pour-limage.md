<p>I just made a reservation for 2 weeks from august, 29th for <a href="http://www.visapourlimage.com/">Visa pour l’image</a>, the annual international photojournalist event. I’m very excited about going there, I had to cancel last year because of my master degree.

<p>If you live in Perpignan and agree to share your internet connection sometimes during the evening, I’ll be glad to use it :-) (internet shop will probably be very expensive).</p>

<p><br /><br />
I am also planning my trip to <a href="http://www.whatthehack.org/">what the hack</a>, a hacker event that should bring more than 2.000 humans, not including hackers. If you want to go to only one event, that should be it. If you’re French and want to ride with us, <a href="http://wth.linuxfr.org">check this website</a>.</p>
