Apparently the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/WWDC/">WWDC</a> is not the only event that solds out before it even started... <a href="https://tickets.har2009.org/index.php">Har2009 is now sold out</a>, no more tickets, plus de tickets, kaput!

What is HAR ? Probably the best Hacker oriented event that occurs only every 4 years. It usually holds at least 2,500 people or more, and I've personally attended <a href="http://www.hip97.nl/">HIP 97</a>, <a href="http://www.hal2001.org/">HAL 2001</a>, <a href="http://www.ccc.de/camp/2003/index.en.html">CCC 2003</a> (different organizers), <a href="http://wiki.whatthehack.org/index.php/Main_Page">WTH 2005</a>, and will do so for <a href="http://www.har2009.org/">HAR 2009</a>.

See you there.
