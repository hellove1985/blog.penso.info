Recently HSBC forced all its French customers to use a Secure Key system,
either through a dedicated box, or through an iPhone application. The purpose
of the system is to make your bank account safer.

It sure will be as you either won't be able to connect to your bank account
anymore, or not wanting to connect to it. Thank you HSBC!

#### How does it go with Secure Key ?

You select the iPhone application, activate your device (a pain in the a** but
as least you do that only once), and every time you want to login on your
account to see your bank details, you must:

1. Enter your Internet ID on their webpage (11 digits)
2. Answer a security answer
3. Take your iPhone
4. Enter your Internet ID on the phone (11 digits)
5. Enter a specific code on the device (can't be the same code, about 8 to 10 chars I think)
6. Enter the temporary code displayed on the iPhone on the computer

That's where you go WHAT THE FUCK. Every single time you want to see your bank
details, that's 6 steps. Not to say if you're living in the UK but want to
connect to your French bank account you must download the app from the French
AppStore, which you might not have an account on as you're using the British
one. You're the lucky winner.

#### Replacing your device

I happened to get my device replaced by the [Apple
Store](http://www.apple.com/store), and that goes BOOM for HSBC. Starting the
application on my new iPhone says something like "Enter a code from your
previous device".

But I don't have my old iPhone anymore... That's when I decided to call
*customer support*. The HSBC guy said: 

> “You should have unactivated your account within the HSBC app from your old
> iPhone before giving it back to Apple.[^1]”
>
> <cite>—HSBC Customer support</cite>

He told me not to worry, he was sending me a new code to connect. I was
expecting it by SMS. It's delivered by **regular mail** within 48 hours. WTF.

He said I should then choose the dedicated box instead of the iPhone, that's
**another 10 days delay**. WTF.

Here I am, not being able to check my bank details for a few days when I need
it, because I got my iPhone replaced. Now let me tell you I'm quite worried
about traveling for a few months abroad.

**Worst experience ever**[^2]. [Mint](http://www.mint.com), please come to Europe.

I wish I could have contacted HSBC about this, but their French branch lists no
details about [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com),
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) or any social networks. The customer
support over the phone doesn't look like it will escalate my complaints
neither. If you do have issues with HSBC I suggest tagging
[#HSBC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hsbc&src=typd) and maybe one day,
they'll read it.

If you liked this post, drop me a note at

anyway telling me how to improve it.

Thanks for reading.
