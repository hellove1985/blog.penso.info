After a few months of hard work, the new version of my <a href="http://2apn.com">push notification application</a> is finally available for your iPhones and iPads (it supports multiple devices and synchronize content between them). I'm really looking for feedback for this application, so feel free to contact me if you have feature requests. You can get it at <a href="http://2apn.com">http://2apn.com</a>.

It allows you to receive real-time informations from RSS feeds, Twitter, Email, has an API to use to push to you directly. You can then share content through Facebook/Twitter, Email. There are favorites, thread support, and so on.
