<p>Merry christmas to everyone who cares about that sort of things. New year is coming soon, sooner than what I expected.</p>

<p>The 2006 TODO list for Fabien, I :</p>

<ul>
<li>may go to India around March</li>
<li>-will buy a D200 nikon or something similar as a digital SLR- (done).</li>
<li>-may buy a Mamiya 7ii to play medium- (done).</li>
<li>-should get a wide voigtlander 15mm lens- (bought on ebay, -waiting for the deliver-, received it.)</li>
<li>should care less about all thoses gears, and take more pictures</li>
<li>will travel more, for sure. A lot more.</li>
<li>hope I’ll go to “Visa”:http://www.visapourlimage.com/ again.</li>
<li>should finish “uucpssh”:http://www.uucpssh.org/ (new version)</li>
<li>may continue the development of “rdisk”:http://rdisk.net/ to provide other features (sharing read only to friends?)</li>
<li>will replace an <em>old</em> iiyama screen with a LCD (lacie 119, or eizo?) to be able to work on pictures</li>
<li>Add features to my “auth<em>generator”:http://penso.info/code/auth</em>generator for “rails”:http://www.rubyonrails.org/.</li>
<li>will look at the lomo LC-A if I ever find a good price</li>
<li>-may look at the Marantz PMD 660 to record sound and add multimedia to my pics- (waiting to receive it from ebay, if I haven’t been screwed up).</li>
<li>will look at photography internships in agencies, if my profile ever interest them</li>
<li>many other things I haven’t thought about so far</li>
</ul>

<p>Why bothering to write such a list? To confirm 90% of the list has changed at the end of the year 2006 :-)</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em>: Ok in fact everything that concerns the gears is going to be done before the next 2 weeks…</p>
