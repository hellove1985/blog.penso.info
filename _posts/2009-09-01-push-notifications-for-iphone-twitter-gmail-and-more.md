The application I've been working for the last months is <a href="http://bit.ly/19T8V7">now available on the appstore</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/19T8V7">Apple Push Notifications</a> with a REST API for you, able to run any iphone applications, with Twitter plugin included, and GPush too.

All that for a very low amount. Let me know what you think.
