So as you readers know, I'm currently traveling in California (I'm now staying a bit in San Francisco), where I had the chance to meet many developers, designers, etc. I was looking to meet the guys from <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Labs">Orange Labs</a>, and I randomly found a<a href="http://twitter.com/OrangeWorldwide"> Orange twitter </a>account.

I asked how to get in touch with them and I got a reply : "<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">@<a href="http://twitter.com/fabienpenso">fabienpenso</a> = Email us or call us = <a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/UuoT7" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/UuoT7</a>" which goes to <a href="http://orange.com/en_EN/tools/contact/index.jsp">http://orange.com/en_EN/tools/contact/index.jsp</a>.</span></span>

Thanks Orange, I really needed <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> to get such an information! However it did not prevent me from extending my travel here of 3 weeks.
