I am now working as a Senior API developer for <a href="http://www.preplaysports.com">PrePlay</a>, a NYC based company about mobile and tablet games related to enhance your experience while watching sports on TV. I've own a TV only a few years of my life (that was a while ago, I've given it to neighbors when I understood I wasn't using it), so it's kind of funny to be joining such a company. I will be working in their Paris office (next to Gare de l'Est). Yes, the Engineer team is French! The upcoming year is pretty exciting: happy new year for 2013!

The last full-time job I had was at <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, which I've quit in June 2011. It was one of my best job experience, I just can't summarize it in a single blog post but it changed the way I see working with other people, and it would now be difficult for me to work with negative people. The Engineers at Causes are super positive, and super skilled. Thank you guys, and if you want to learn as much as I did  <a href="http://www.causes.com/jobs">you can apply there</a>.

Since then:
<ul>
	<li>I've traveled about 16,000kms in India on a Royal Enfield (2 trips of about 4 months each) and <a href="http://fabienpenso.com/stories/haridwar">brought many pictures</a> (more on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/penso">my flickr</a>: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/penso/sets/72157627878039060/">set1</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/penso/sets/72157630899010954/">set2</a>).</li>
	<li>I've released a Facebook client iPhone application named <a href="http://www.likerapp.com/purchase">Liker</a>, but didn't yet give it the love it should get. Updates coming later.</li>
	<li>I've updated my photography website <a href="http://www.fabienpenso.com">www.fabienpenso.com</a> and just got featured on the <a href="http://blog.leica-camera.com/photographers/interviews/fabien-penso-an-indian-carnet-de-passage/">official Leica Blog</a>. Thanks Leica!</li>
	<li>My Facebook photography page <a href="http://facebook.com/pensophotography">Penso Photography</a> got over 4,500 likes, my <a href="http://twitter.com/fabienpenso">Twitter account</a> past 4,600 followers.</li>
	<li>My <a href="http://2apn.com">Push application</a> is doing good, pushing close to 400,000 pushes every single day of the year.</li>
</ul>
