I will be at <a href="http://www.har2009.org/">HAR2009</a> from Tuesday 11th to Monday 17th. I had few funny things in mind to do with iPhone development but I finally had no time to work on them. Therefore I'll come empty hands, I've been too busy working on <a href="http://appnotifications.com">push notifications</a> and other projects (<a href="http://www.36pulp.com/">36Pulp</a>, and some iPhone apps).

If you happen to read this blog and be around, leave me a note here or on <a href="http://twitter.com/fabienpenso">my twitter</a>. I'll publish pictures from <a href="http://www.har2009.org/">HAR2009</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/penso">my flickr account</a>.
