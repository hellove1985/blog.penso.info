### Short story

* Buy [a single 3 euros diode](http://uk.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/stps60170ct/diode-schottky-2x30a-170v/dp/1295334?Ntt=129-5334) (or a few...)
* Read [this article](http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18460501) to disassemble your screen
* Change the defective diode using a soldering gun
* Still not working? Buy a [new power board](http://www.super-laptop-parts.com/dell-3008wfp-power-supply-board-0728d04205-p-19615.html)

### Long story

![dell screen working](http://distilleryimage2.s3.amazonaws.com/92dce006bd9911e2838b22000ae81190_7.jpg)

I bought myself a 30" DELL 3008 WFP screen in 2008 (for 1,600 euros). I was
super happy at the time, and it even took me a few days to get used to so much
space on my desktop. I had decided about that purchase after reading articles
mentionning how faster you were with a bigger desktop, and what the heck being
on a computer all day long is my job.

Sadly, after a few years of good use, the screen went pitch black. I called
DELL and they said they don't repair screens, but were happy about selling me a
new one, at full price... I insisted but no repair, no help for fixing it, no
contacts for help. I went to the [AppleStore](http://store.apple.com/) and
bought a [Thunderbolt
display](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC914LL/B/apple-thunderbolt-display-27-inch?fnode=53),
done.

I kept my broken DELL on a side knowing one day I would fix it. Man I'm happy I
did. Reading online (see my [DELL
bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:penso/t:dell)), I found [this
article](http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18460501) showing
you how to disassemble it, and fixing it with [a single 3 euros
diode](http://uk.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/stps60170ct/diode-schottky-2x30a-170v/dp/1295334?Ntt=129-5334).
Please note I have no specific soldering skills but borrowed a soldering gun
from [a friend](http://benjamin.sonntag.fr/) and I actually managed to replace
the diode just fine.

The screen worked... for a few minutes :) I tried replacing with a new diode
again, tested the diode with multimeters but decided to spend more time and
money on a complete [new power
board](http://www.super-laptop-parts.com/dell-3008wfp-power-supply-board-0728d04205-p-19615.html)
on a shady looking website but I actually received the power board 2 weeks
later, from Hong Kong.

Replaced the board (was fast, as I disassembled my screen twice already), and
[tada](http://instagram.com/p/ZWEwtjuS-G/) it just worked. Hopefully I'll use
this a few more years. Yes, I know I shouldn't just connect an Apple TV to
this.

Oh and screw you DELL, I won't buy from you again.
