I had developed an iPhone application for the VU' Agency, and it's finally <a
href="http://bit.ly/a4HuzQ">live on the AppStore</a>. It's available in French
and English, and include more than 600 stories from the VU' Agency. If you like
photography or work as a photographer, this is probably a must have.
