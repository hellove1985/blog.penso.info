<a href="http://tweetsell.it/">TweetSell.it</a> allows you to see what's being
sold on Twitter, in real-time. You can also see <a
href="http://tweetsell.it/products/near">what's being sold near you</a>, or
search for specific items like the <a
href="http://tweetsell.it/products/search?s=iPhone4">iPhone4</a>. I've had the
idea for a long time, but I only released the service a few days ago.

What do you think? How do you like it? What should be included? Let me know
here or through my twitter <a
href="http://twitter.com/fabienpenso">@fabienpenso</a>. There are more features
to come later like online payment.
