<p>You want to use remote disk space through webdav, because you need to store files or anything else.</p>

<p>Well why not use “rdisk”:http://rdisk.net/ then ? :) “rdisk”:http://rdisk.net is a way to get “remote disk”:http://rdisk.net/ through “webdav”:http://rdisk.net/. It’s not online yet, but expect that to happen within the next weeks.</p>

<p>The website will run “rails”:http://www.rubyonrails.org/, obviously.</p>
