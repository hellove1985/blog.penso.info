<p>I’ve thought about it for months, I’ve dreamed about it for even longer. I’ve made it, I bought a film scanner! I can now spend days to digitalize my films from my previous trip.</p>

<p>Just a taste, you can see some pictures taken during a travel to Myanmar. See “my flickr set for it”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/penso/sets/1401242/.</p>
