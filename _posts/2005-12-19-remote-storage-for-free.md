<p>One of the many projects I work on is available as beta. It offers you free “online storage”:http://rdisk.net/. While I finish it, there are no quotas, no bandwidth limit, but I welcome you to not abuse of it :) It uses “rails”:http://www.rubyonrails.org/, off course.</p>

<p>It’s available at “http://rdisk.net”:http://rdisk.net/ and you can send me feedbacks if you’d like..</p>
