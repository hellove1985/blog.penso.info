I don't post here much the last months, I tend to post a few links on <a href="http://penso.info">penso.info</a> (tumblr powered) or communicate through my twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/fabienpenso">@fabienpenso</a>. I've been working for a few months on a new Facebook iPhone app. It's not ready yet and still needs some love, but the current state of the app is going super well. You might want to look at the teaser I've put at <a href="http://lets.f4ce.it">http://lets.f4ce.it</a> (love the link), and put your email if you wanna know first about it.

If you're a blogger, run an iPhone related website let me know, I could have you playing with it early.
