<a href="http://blog.penso.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/thinktank.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-386" title="thinktank" src="http://blog.penso.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/thinktank.png" alt="" width="296" height="140" /></a>We all have many projects in mind, we all have upcoming projects we're working on. The web is full of informations we'd like to keep for this project, things to look later, content to share with potential partners.

I have not seen a service which allow me to put all this informations together, to talk about, or to keep for future use. I did<a href="penso.info/tmp/thinktank.pdf"> a quick mindmap</a> about what such a service could be offering. It could be including files attachements, messages, comments, twitter, google searches, links or whatever else is usefull for such a service.

We need such a service for ourselves (<a href="http://www.conovae.com/">CONOVAE</a>, <a href="http://www.adebe.fr/">Adebe Networks</a> and friends), do you have anything close to this to suggest? Will I end up writing a mashup of this?
