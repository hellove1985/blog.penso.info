We need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol">SIP</a> software for Mac so bad... Not something that <a href="http://www.counterpath.net/x-lite.html">looks like this</a> (X-Lite) with awful design and which does not work anymore on Snow Leopard anyway, something more of a Mac user experience like <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/fontcase/">FontCase</a> (who won an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/index.html">Apple Design Award</a>).

Pleeeeease developers, write one ! Get a <a href="http://www.sipfoundry.org/developers-info.html">SIP library</a> and build a GUI on top of it. And yes, I'm willing to pay for such a nice software...
