A little less than a year ago, I started to work for Causes, a great experience
overall. First time I've worked full time for a US based company, and the best
users/employees ratio you can imagine.Â <a title="Causes.com"
href="http://www.causes.com/">Causes.com</a> announces 150 millions users (fact
is it's a little more), run by less than 10 Software Engineers. The last months
I've worked:

* A lot on the <a href="http://ogp.me/">Facebook Open Graph</a>
* On the Email infrastructure (emailing all those users without being flagged as SPAM is more difficult than you think)
* Improving test run, using decentralized methods (hydra, but don't use hydra really, just upgrade to rspec and use other tools)

The Engineer team I've met at Causes is probably one of the best I've met so far, I've learned a lot about:

* Scrum and Sprint jobs
* <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> which I ended up liking a lot
* How important Git commit messages is for your team, more important than for you
* Ruby. I've been a Ruby developer for years but yes, I've learned a lot more with talented people
* More stuff I've forgot as I'm typing this

I you ever get the chance to interview or join Causes, you'll have a lot of fun
and join a great project, not to say <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/penso/5437917682/in/photostream">an amazing
office</a>. But tomorrow will be my last day there, and I'll be free for the
next weeks to meet you.

I'm flying back to Paris on July 8th, and don't plan to come back for now
unless I get a good opportunity in San Francisco before leaving. I do iPhone
and Rails development but really like doing iPhone applications overall. I'll
also work on <a href="http://www.tweetsell.it">tweetsell.it</a> and <a
href="http://www.2apn.com">Push4</a> on a side.

If we haven't met yet, please contact me :) I'm free and look for amazing
project to join. You'll find <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/fabienpenso">my linkedin profile</a> and <a
href="http://tmp.penso.info/tmp/cv_en.pdf">my resume</a> if you care.
I'll also be at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> next week
and will try to show up in a few events this month.
