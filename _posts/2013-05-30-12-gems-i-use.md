12. [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever): Clear syntax for writing and deploying cron jobs

Which ones do you use yourself? Let me know over
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/fabienpenso).

#### Update

Some more I got from you guys:

* [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors): Better Errors
  replaces the standard Rails error page with a much better and more useful
  error page. It is also usable outside of Rails in any Rack app as Rack
  middleware.
* [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry): An IRB replacement
* [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form): Rails forms made
  easy.
* [irbtools](https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools): Improves Ruby’s irb
  console. Unlike pry, you are still in your normal irb, but you have colors
  and lots of helpful methods. It’s designed to work out-of-the-box so there is
  no reason to not use it!
* [nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri): Nokogiri (鋸) is an
  HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser. Among Nokogiri’s many features is the
  ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.
* [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler): Bundler keeps ruby
	applications running the same code on every machine. Of course I'd use this
	in *every single projects*.
* [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari): A Scope & Engine based,
  clean, powerful, customizable and sophisticated paginator for modern web app
  frameworks and ORMs. Seems like a nice replacement to
  [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate)
* [Active Admin](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin): Framework for
  creating administration style interfaces.
