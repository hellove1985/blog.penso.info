I'm working on a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/plugins.html">plugin</a> for managing <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> 3.0 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service">Apple Push Notification</a>. Because this is under NDA I can't say much about it here, but you'll find a password protected <a href="http://www.git-scm.org/">git</a> repository on the <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/community/iphone/">Apple Developer Forums</a>, in <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/12518">this specific post</a>. Patch and feedbacks welcome if you are an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone developer</a>.

I also bought my tickets for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/products/wwdc.html">WWDC 2009</a>, and <a href="http://blog.penso.info/2009/03/25/voyage-en-californie/">will be in California</a> from April 30th to June 14th. I might also be at the <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">Railsconf 2009</a> at Las Vegas but only on Tuesday and Wednesday.

I'd be interested to meet anyone in the iPhone/Rails community reading this blog.
