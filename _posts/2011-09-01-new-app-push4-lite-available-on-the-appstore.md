It's free, has advertising, and is not limited in any way. If you need push notifications for RSS feeds, Twitter, Emails, Facebook, or if you want to use an API to send yourself notifications, this is it.

The original Push application has about 50,000 users, hopefully the lite version will boost it even more. Spread the words, and send me feedback.
