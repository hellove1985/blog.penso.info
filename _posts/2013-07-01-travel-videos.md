July 2012. during my last trip with [Arnaud le
Canu](https://www.facebook.com/arnaud.lecanu), each of us carried a
[GoPro](http://gopro.com/) camera. Arnaud spent days (weeks?) to edit what he
brought back, and the result is finally available. Since he only traveled 3
weeks with me, the videos are covering the trip from Delhi to Leh, through
Kinnaur, Spiti and Lahaul.

I'm going to travel soon again, and since people who are following this blog
are probably only interested about technical posts, I created another
one focusing on my travels. You can see it here: [my travel
blog](http://travels.penso.info/). The [first
post](http://travels.penso.info/2013/06/18/the-beginning-of-my-india-travels/)
explains how I started traveling in India in 2006, and the one named [Going
from Delhi to Ladakh on
Enfield](http://travels.penso.info/2013/06/18/spiti-valley-ladakh/) tells more
about my previous trip.
