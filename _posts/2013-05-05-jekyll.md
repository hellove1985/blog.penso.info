description: Moved to Jekyll
---
Like all the popular kids in the block, I moved this website to
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I ran my main blog with Wordpress
for years (after a short stop by home made code, then mephisto, and Typo), I've
now bundled all my little websites to a single one. My other [photography
website](http://www.fabienpenso.com) is running [heritage](http://heritage.io),
a rails backend I'm working on to host photo websites, allowing photographers
to sell prints online.

Looking at my archive page, I can see how little I'm blogging anyway
([facebook](http://facebook.com) seems to have replaced my destination for what
I write). I removed comments, and you can send me mails directly or use social
networks (aka Daring Fireball style).

Tools I'm using for this:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
* [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) (free alternative to [TypeKit](https://typekit.com/), sorry [Ryan](http://www.ryancarver.com/))
* A few hours of work

Something you notice with static files is how fast your website is. I've always
pushed for cache everywhere and static files, and it feels nice to go back to
it.

I've built websites since 1995, but something I find amazing the recent years
is how efficient I've become building new projects and website. Thanks to
[Github](http://github.com) and all the code available out there.

#### Update 27th May, 2013

Following my recent post about [getting a job in San Francisco]({% post_url 2013-05-25-getting-a-job-in-san-francisco %}),
 I had a lot of e-mails about my blog design. I did it myself and got inspired while reading [Matt
Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/). I tend to like clean white simple designs.

Feel free to reuse everything I did from [my
source code](https://github.com/penso/blog.penso.info). While I think asking
anyone to add *design by ...* is useless, I do appreciate links back to my
blog.

Thank you :)
